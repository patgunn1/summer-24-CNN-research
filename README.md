# summer-24-CNN-research

This repo contains all relevant files from my summer 2024 research into using 1D CNNs for parameter estimation in Nicholson's Blowfly model. I worked under the supervision of Dr Amanda Lenzi, and used ideas introduced in [Neural networks for parameter estimation in intractable models](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167947323000737) by Lenzi et al.

This repo contains two main parts: summary notes and code. For the first of these:
- `Manuscript Draft` contains a (sadly unfinished) draft of a paper summarising the findings of this research, including some commentary on motivation and full referencing.
